Project Title: CSV Data Analysis and Visualization Web Application
Overview
This project is a Django-based web application that allows users to upload CSV files, perform data analysis using pandas and numpy, and display the results and visualizations on the web interface. The application provides a simple and user-friendly interface for users to analyze their data without needing to write any code.

Features
CSV File Upload:

Users can upload CSV files through a web form.
The uploaded files are temporarily stored for processing.

Data Processing:

The application uses pandas to read the uploaded CSV file.
It performs basic data analysis tasks such as:
Displaying the first few rows of the data.
Calculating summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns.
Identifying and handling missing values.

Data Visualization:

The application generates basic plots using matplotlib and seaborn.
It creates histograms for numerical columns.
The plots are displayed on the web page.
User Interface:

Django templates are used to create a clean and intuitive user interface.
The data analysis results and visualizations are presented in an organized manner.
